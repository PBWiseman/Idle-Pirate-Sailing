<h1 align="center"> Idle Pirate Sailing </h1>

Idle Pirate Sailing is a simple 2d mobile idle game. This game was originally made for a third year Bachelor of IT Mobile Game Development paper at Otago Polytechnic. It was intended to be a minimum viable product and was my second time making a mobile game and my first time making this style of mobile game. I decided to continue work on this after my course finished and am in the process of slowly chipping away at it. I have decided to redesign the game and turn it from an endless runner to a game with free movement focussed on collecting resources and combining and upgrading parts of your ship.

## How to play

You can download the game on the [releases page](https://github.com/PBWiseman/Idle-Pirate-Sailing/releases), or on [itch.io](https://pbwiseman.itch.io/idle-pirate-sailing).
You will need to manually upload the APK to your phone.
